The Vic 361 — Event Collector
Fetches events from public Victoria, TX sources and outputs candidates.json
(raw/unscreened) plus, optionally, docs/events.json (the bundled fallback
the static site reads when the Railway Postgres store has nothing).

Source of truth for the live site:
  - In production, the Express app on Railway serves /events.json from
    Postgres (the `published_events` table written by the admin's
    Save & Publish flow). This is the live, curated source.
  - docs/events.json is a static bundled SNAPSHOT used as a fallback when
    Railway has not yet published anything (fresh deploy) or when the site
    is served directly from GitHub Pages without the Express layer.
  - candidates.json is the full collector output — every raw event the
    scrapers found this run, ready for the admin to screen and pick from.

Because docs/events.json is committed to the repo and serves as a fallback,
the weekly CI run uses --candidates-only so it does NOT overwrite the
curated fallback with un-screened, un-published events. Local/manual runs
without that flag keep the old behavior for backward compatibility.

Data sources (in priority order):
  1. local_events.yaml — manually curated + recurring events (BACKBONE)
  2. City of Victoria calendar — individual event pages scraped
  3. Victoria Chamber of Commerce — event detail pages
  4. OpenAI API — extracts events from FB/IG posts and polishes
     descriptions + icons on the merged data (optional)

Usage:
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  python collect_events.py                          # writes candidates.json + ./events.json
  python collect_events.py --candidates-only        # CI-safe: only writes candidates.json
  python collect_events.py --output /path/to.json   # custom output path
  python collect_events.py --days 14                # 14 days ahead (default: 7)
  python collect_events.py --skip-web               # local YAML only
  python collect_events.py --skip-ai                # skip AI cleanup

# metadata), the date is in the window, and the usual merge filters (area,
# non-event, dead links, duplicates) pass. Off without GEMINI_API_KEY;
# GEMINI_ENABLED=0 turns it off; GEMINI_MODEL picks the model.

#
# Every LLM call in the collector (AI review + FB/IG post extraction) goes
# through _openai_chat. Perplexity Sonar was removed in Oct 2026, and its
# web-search discovery source went with it: OpenAI chat completions don't
# search the web, and the scrapers + Apify already cover the same venues.
#
# The payload sticks to fields every current chat model accepts: no
# temperature (gpt-5-family models reject non-default values) and
# max_completion_tokens instead of the deprecated max_tokens. Reasoning
# models spend part of that budget thinking before they answer, so the
# callers' limits are generous and reasoning_effort is pinned low to keep
# the ~80 weekly calls inside the workflow step timeout.

# ─── GAP FILLING (Gemini + Google Search) ────────────────────────────────────
#
# Hand-added and post-extracted events often arrive thin: "Trunk or treat."
# with no time or link (the Oct 2026 community list), so the page says little
# and the AI review has nothing to work from. This looks each thin event up
# with Google Search grounding and fills in only what's blank: time, street
# address, a link, and a fuller description when the current one is a stub.
#
# Same trust rules as Gemini discovery: nothing is taken unless the answer
# names a source page on a site Gemini actually cited, and a link must load
# and name the event (or be on a cited site that blocks the check). Nothing
# set by hand or by a venue is overwritten. Results are cached in
# enrichment_cache.json (committed by weekly-collect.yml) so each event is
# looked up once; a miss is retried after ENRICH_RETRY_DAYS. Events with no
# link go first (every event should have a source link when one exists, so a
# hand-added event only needs a name, date and venue), then soonest first,

#     1. Rewrite the description as ≤160 chars, max 2 short sentences,
#        no emojis, no venue/date repetition, neutral local-newsletter tone.
#     2. Pick 1–3 icons from the canonical set, ranked by relevance.
#     3. Re-evaluate the `free` flag (true / false).
#
# It does NOT change name, date, time, venue, address, or url — those come
# from the source of truth (yaml/scrapers) and shouldn't be invented by AI.
#
# Calls are batched (default 8 events per request) so we only make ~10–15
# API calls per daily run instead of one giant prompt or one-call-per-event.
#
# Degrades gracefully:
#   - No OPENAI_API_KEY → skip, return events untouched.
#   - The model returns malformed JSON for a batch → keep that batch's originals.
#   - Per-event response missing fields → keep that event's original values.

For each event you receive, return:
  - description: ≤160 characters, max 2 short sentences. Neutral, friendly local-newsletter tone. NO emojis. Do NOT repeat the event name, venue name, address, date, or time (the site already shows those). If the input description has no useful info beyond what's already in the name/venue, write a brief 1-line description of what attendees can expect based on the event type.
  - icons: 1–3 strings from this exact set: food, music, family, drinks, arts, shopping, outdoors, community, free. Order by relevance (most representative first). Use "free" only when the event is genuinely free to attend. Only use an icon the name or description actually supports: never add music unless it mentions music, a band, a DJ, a concert, karaoke or an open mic. When the input says little, use fewer icons rather than guessing.
  - free: boolean, true if the event is free to attend.
  - appeal: integer 1–5. How many people in <<CITY>> would want to hear about this, and how special it is. 5: a big one-time draw for the whole town (festival, parade, big concert, fair, holiday lighting, rodeo). 4: a notable one-time event with broad appeal (touring act, community celebration, big fundraiser, family carnival). 3: an ordinary good outing (live music at a bar, trivia, a market, a kids' event). 2: routine or narrow (weekly bingo, a club or group meeting, a class or workshop for a few people, a store's kids craft). 1: very niche or barely an event (a support group, an orientation, a promo or deal).
  - keep: boolean. false when this is NOT a real event someone can attend at a set time and place, for example a job or internship posting, "now booking" field trips or parties, a menu or daily special with nothing happening, a "National ___ Day" post, a giveaway, a closure or holiday-hours notice, or registration for something that isn't on this date. When unsure, keep: true.

Icon guidance:
  - food: meals, food trucks, tastings, farmers markets, BBQ, restaurants
  - music: live music, concerts, DJs, open mics, karaoke
  - family: kid-friendly, story time, baby/toddler events, all-ages. Never for trainings, certification courses, seminars or anything aimed at adults, even when the topic is kids or youth
  - drinks: bars, breweries, wineries, beer/wine/cocktail events (21+)
  - arts: art shows, theatre, gallery, crafts, dance, painting
  - shopping: markets with vendors, pop-ups, retail events, craft fairs
  - outdoors: parks, hiking, sports, festivals held outside, gardening
  - community: meetings, fundraisers, civic, volunteer, library programs
  - free: zero cost to attend (also set free=true)

Return ONLY a JSON array, one object per input event, each echoing that event's id: {"id": N, "description": "...", "icons": [...], "free": true|false, "appeal": 1-5, "keep": true|false}. No prose, no markdown fences."""

#   - Recurring kid programs (toddler/baby/preschool story time) are limited to
#     ONE appearance per 7-day window each — the most recent one wins.
#   - Adult/specialty events (book clubs, lectures, AgriLife, makerspace) take
#     priority and are kept until the daily cap fills up.

#      Nave Museum, big festivals). Reliable when venues bother to create them.
#
#   2. apify/facebook-posts-scraper   → posts from our high-confidence venue
#      list. This is the gap-filler for bars/restaurants that announce events
#      as posts ("Live music tonight 7pm") rather than formal Events. Posts
#      are funneled through an OpenAI prompt that extracts dated events.
#
# Both actors share APIFY_TOKEN and the same hard-limit detection. If the
# monthly cap is hit, we set a tombstone in the workspace so subsequent calls
# in the same run skip immediately rather than wasting 30s per actor.

# ─── SOURCE: APIFY (Facebook posts → OpenAI event extraction) ───────────────
#
# Why this exists: many Victoria bars/restaurants announce events as Facebook
# *posts* ("Live music tonight 8pm with Donny Edwards") rather than formal
# Event pages. The events-scraper actor never sees those, so weeknight density
# at venues like Aero Crafters / Moonshine / The Hideaway / Lone Star is
# systematically thin. This scraper pulls recent posts from each
# high-confidence venue, then asks OpenAI to extract any
# specific-dated events from the post text.
#
# Cost shape (rough): Apify $2/1000 posts × ~9 venues × 25 posts each
#   ≈ 225 posts ≈ $0.45 per run. Plus 1 OpenAI call per venue with posts
#   (≈10 calls, ~$0.005 each) ≈ $0.05. Total ≤ $0.50/run, ~$15/mo daily.
#
# Toggle with FB_POSTS_ENABLED=1 (default off until Apify cap resets).


# Apify resultsLimit per venue page. Bumped 25 → 50 because most low-volume
# venues only had ~1 post in a 14-day window during the first production run
# — a wider net catches recurring-event mentions buried in older posts
# ("Live music every Friday" remains useful even when 20 days old).
_POSTS_PER_VENUE = 50

# Lookback for posts. Bumped 14 → 30 days for the same reason. The extraction
# prompt still constrains *event dates* to the collection window, so older
# posts are only kept when they describe a future-dated or recurring event.
_POSTS_LOOKBACK_DAYS = 30

# Hard ceiling on the number of FB venues we'll scrape in a single run.
# Mirrors _IG_POSTS_MAX_VENUES — added after run 25127431431 where the

# AI Review past the step timeout. ``None`` = no cap (legacy behavior),
# which is what FB has shipped with historically. Override at runtime by

Rules:
- "weekday" is the day of the week the post gives for the event (e.g. "Thursday"). Copy it from the post; don't work it out from a date.
- Recurring events the post says happen EVERY week ("every Wednesday", "live music every Friday & Saturday", "Trivia Tuesdays", "brunch on Sundays"): emit ONE object per weekday with "recurring": true and that "weekday". Leave "date" empty; dates are filled in later. A 20-day-old post saying "Live music every Friday" still counts.
- "starts" and "ends" are only for recurring events with a stated first or last date ("Starting Oct 16, karaoke every Friday" → "starts":"2026-10-16"; "every Saturday in October" → "starts" the 1st, "ends" the 31st). Leave them empty when the post gives no limit, and on one-time events.
- Everything else is a one-time event: "recurring": false, with its ACTUAL "date" between {today_str} and {end_str}, regardless of when the post was made.
- A dated schedule for one particular week ("This week @ the farm: Sept 24 bingo, Sept 25 music") lists one-time events for those dates only. Never carry those dates forward to later weeks; if the dates are before {today_str}, skip them (but keep any "every week" line in the same post as recurring).
- For relative dates ("this Friday", "tomorrow", "next Saturday"), resolve them against the post's own posted-on date — then check the resolved date is in the window.
- "name" is the event's own name as the post gives it ("Plant and Sip", "Trivia Night", "Fall Market"). When a guest business or performer is the draw, add them: "Plant and Sip with Scenic Root". Never build a name from a cut-off or partial phrase, and never end a name with "a", "the", "and", "for" or "...".
- "description" says only what the post says. Don't add performers, live music, food or other details the post doesn't mention.
- A post ending in "[post continues]" was cut short; use only what you can read and don't guess the rest.
- Skip posts that are pure promo, photo dumps, customer thank-yous, or undated announcements.
- Skip events that already happened (post-date BEFORE today's date with no recurring signal).
- Only include events held in {TOWN['city_state']} or elsewhere in {TOWN['area_name']}. Skip events in other towns ({TOWN['nearby_examples']}, etc.).
- Return [] if no events found. No prose, no markdown fences."""
