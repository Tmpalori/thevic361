"""Is a new town ready to launch? (MULTI_CITY_PLAN.md 5.3, the automatic part.)

    python3 scripts/launch_check.py --town bay [--site https://www.thebay979.com]
    HQ_API_KEY=… python3 scripts/launch_check.py --town bay      # also checks the HQ feed

Reads the town from towns/<slug>/town.json (TOWNS_DIR to override) and asks
its live site, GET only, nothing posted and no key needed (HQ's aside):

  - health: up, on its own Postgres (so the boot guards passed);
  - /api/config: it runs as this town and publishes to towns/<slug>/;
  - public pages: they answer, and none names Victoria's site, domain,
    Google tag or "Victoria, TX";
  - robots.txt and the sitemap point at the town's own host;
  - /events.json answers with at least 10 upcoming events (the hourly
    uptime check's own floor) and a collect in the last 8 days
    (`collected_at`, the candidates auto-publish last put live);
  - /api/config says the town's workflows are on (`town_workflows`:
    TOWN_WORKFLOWS=1, set once its GitHub Environment exists);
  - towns/<slug>/venues.json is seeded (the collector never borrows
    Victoria's);
  - HQ: /api/hq/summary answers with HQ_API_KEY as this town.

A town that answers but isn't actually collecting fails: an empty site
looks fine page by page.

Then it lists what only a person can check (a test newsletter to
delivered@resend.dev, a Stripe test-mode checkout, a reply landing in
#inbox with the town's tag, HQ showing the town, Victoria's live check).
Exits 1 when any automatic check fails. Victoria isn't a launch: use
scripts/live_check.py for it.

Must be done before launch (MULTI_CITY_PLAN.md; each one blocks a launch):
  [ ] 3.3 the town's GitHub Environment (SITE_URL, Meta, NTFY, cron secrets,
      SLACK_TOWN_TAG), then TOWN_WORKFLOWS=1 on its Railway service
  [ ] 3.4 its own scheduled collects (town matrix, staggered crons,
      fail-fast: false; Event Check gated on the town)
  [ ] 3.5 the workflows' gates call the town's own SITE_URL
  [ ] 3.7 test_workflows.py pins the town inputs (Victoria's crons unchanged)
  [ ] 2.6 Railway watch paths on every service, so one town's commits don't
      redeploy every town (by town #3 at the latest)
  [ ] RAILWAY.md "New town on Railway" followed end to end (fresh secrets)

Check by hand before launch:
  [ ] Admin → Newsletter → send a test to delivered@resend.dev (never a real list)
  [ ] A Stripe test-mode checkout on /advertise completes and shows in Admin → Sponsors
  [ ] That checkout page and its receipt show the town's name and logo, not The Vic 361
      (the town has its own Stripe account)
  [ ] A reply to news@ lands in #inbox with the town's [tag]
  [ ] The HQ dashboard shows the town
