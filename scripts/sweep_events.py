"""One look over the published events, after they go live, for anything off.

Runs from .github/workflows/event-check.yml after each collect (once
auto-publish has updated the site) and on Monday morning before the
newsletter. Reads the live /events.json, so it checks what people actually
see, hand edits included, and posts one Slack message: what to look at, or
that everything looks fine. What a rule is sure about (church events,
non-events, exact duplicates, a cut-off name with the whole listing at the
same place that day) it hides on its own through the site's
/api/event-check/hide (server/eventcheck.js; never deletes, restore on admin
Home); judgment calls, and everything the AI finds, only get reported.

Two passes:
  - Rules (free): the collector's own duplicate, out-of-area and non-event
    checks run again over the published list (it can hold hand-added
    events, or ones published before a rule existed), plus a weekday in the
    name that doesn't match the date ("Monday Bingo" on a Tuesday) and
    start times in the middle of the night, or a night event in the morning.
  - AI (one call, a few cents): the whole list at once, so it can see what
    per-event checks can't, like the same event at two venues. Skipped
    without OPENAI_API_KEY; the rules still run.

Do not flag the same recurring event on different days (weekly karaoke, story time). Do not flag generic names at different venues ("Live Music" at two bars is two events). When unsure, leave it out.
