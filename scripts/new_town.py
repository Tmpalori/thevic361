Writes towns/<slug>/town.json (checked by town.py, the same checks the
server runs at boot), an empty local_events.yaml, extras.yaml and
venues.json for the collector (it never falls back to Victoria's root
files for another town), towns/<slug>/public/ for the town's own logo and images, and
adds the town to towns/index.json. It never touches Victoria's files and
refuses a slug that already exists. Then it prints what to run next and
the accounts the owner sets up.

Next, in the repo:
  1. Seed venues (needs APIFY_TOKEN):
       TOWN={slug} python3 discover_venues.py --repo-root towns/{slug}
  2. Add the town's logo set to towns/{slug}/public/ (logo, favicons,
     apple-touch-icon, og-image, skyline day/night, email skyline).
  3. Add its own local calendars as collector sources (collect_events.py
     WEB_SOURCES) and list them in town.json "enabledSources".

Must be done before launch (MULTI_CITY_PLAN.md; each one blocks a launch,
and scripts/launch_check.py fails until the town is really collecting):
  - 3.3 the town's GitHub Environment "{slug}" (SITE_URL={site}, Meta,
    NTFY_TOPIC, cron secrets, SLACK_TOWN_TAG="{settings['city']}"), then
    TOWN_WORKFLOWS=1 on its Railway service. Until then it starts no
    collect, social kit, submission review or event check.
  - 3.4 its own scheduled collects (town matrix, staggered crons,
    fail-fast: false; Event Check gated on the town).
  - 3.5 the workflows' gates call the town's own SITE_URL.
  - 3.7 test_workflows.py pins the town inputs (Victoria's crons unchanged).
  - 2.6 Railway watch paths on every service (by town #3 at the latest).

Accounts and settings (owner; MULTI_CITY_PLAN.md 5.2). Follow
RAILWAY.md "New town on Railway" end to end: every variable, fresh secrets
per town (never copy Victoria's), Stripe webhook events, HQ_TOWNS, domain.
  - Domain {settings['domain']} and DNS.
  - Railway project with its own Postgres (backups on). Variables: TOWN={slug},
    SITE_URL={site}, ADMIN_USERNAME, ADMIN_PASSWORD, ADMIN_SESSION_SECRET,
    the cron secrets, HQ_API_KEY, SLACK_TOWN_TAG="{settings['city']}".
  - Resend: verify {settings['domain']} (SPF, DKIM, MX for replies);
    NEWSLETTER_FROM="{settings['site_name']} <news@{settings['domain']}>"; inbound
    webhook and RESEND_WEBHOOK_SECRET.
  - Stripe: the town's own Stripe account (Stripe → account menu → New
    account), on the same LLC, EIN and payout bank account as Victoria, so
    checkout, receipts and card statements show {settings['site_name']}, not
    The Vic 361. Set its public business name, logo and statement
    descriptor, then its STRIPE_SECRET_KEY, and a webhook endpoint at
    {site}/api/stripe/webhook with its STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET. Products and
    prices are created on the first checkout.
  - Facebook page, Instagram, ad account (the town's GitHub Environment).
  - GA data stream (gaId in town.json), Turnstile hostname, Tremendous campaign.

Before launch (5.3): python3 scripts/launch_check.py --town {slug} passes
(10+ upcoming events, a collect in the last 8 days, workflows on, venues
seeded), the server starts (boot guards pass), a test newsletter to
delivered@resend.dev, a Stripe test-mode checkout, a reply lands in #inbox
tagged with the town, HQ shows it, and Victoria's live check is unchanged.
