/* server/legal.js — Who runs the site, and the pages that say so.
 *
 *   - The business identity the legal pages print: the operator's legal
 *     name (BUSINESS_LEGAL_NAME), a contact email for legal and privacy
 *     requests (BUSINESS_CONTACT_EMAIL, else NEWSLETTER_REPLY_TO, else the
 *     town's own news@ address) and the mailing address the newsletter
 *     already requires (NEWSLETTER_ADDRESS). They're Railway variables, per
 *     town service, read once by createApp (useBusiness). Until the legal
 *     name is set the pages name the site itself ("The Vic 361") as the
 *     operator, never an empty or placeholder string; a missing address is
 *     left out.
 *   - The version of each page (a date string), exported from here so
 *     checkout records which Advertising Terms the buyer agreed to
 *     (server/sponsors.js) and the pages print the same "Last updated".
 *     Change a page's wording that changes what someone agrees to: bump its
 *     version.
 *   - The pages: /privacy, /terms, /advertising-terms (with the refund and
 *     cancellation policy at #refunds; /refunds redirects there) and
 *     /accessibility, in the site's layout and localized through `town`
 *     like every other page (no literal place or site names here).
 *
 * Every promise on these pages must match what the code does. When the
 * booking, refund, review or retention behavior changes, change the page
 * (and its version) in the same PR.
