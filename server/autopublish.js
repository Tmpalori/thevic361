/* server/autopublish.js — Publish the collector's events without a manual step.
 *
 * The weekly collector commits candidates.json, which redeploys the site.
 * On boot (production only) this module publishes those candidates, so the
 * site, social kit and newsletter always have this week's events even if
 * nobody opens the admin.
 *
 * The admin stays in charge:
 *   - Events already published that are still upcoming are kept as-is,
 *     and so are this week's from Monday on, so the week view still shows
 *     the days already past (past ones are never refreshed or taken down)
 *     (including anything the admin added by hand or edited), except that
 *     an event this module added takes the collector's newer copy of it
 *     (time, venue, address, link, description; the name only when the
 *     published one was cut off), so collector fixes reach live events.
 *   - Events this module added on an earlier run that two collector runs in
 *     a row no longer find are taken down: the collector fixed or dropped
 *     them. Never one from a source that only looks back a short time
 *     (FB/IG posts), nor while
 *     its source didn't run ok this time, nor when the new run looks broken
 *     (far fewer events than this module has up).
 *   - An event this module added that the admin later removed is remembered
 *     and not re-added next run, nor under a reworded name (sameEvent).
 *   - Approved community submissions are included.
 *   - Edits (the event_edits overlay) keep applying on read, as before.
 *
 * State lives in the published payload under `auto_publish`, which the
 * admin's Save & Publish already carries forward with other extras.
