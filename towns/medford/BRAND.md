# The Rogue 541: brand starter kit

Starter assets for **The Rogue 541**. They are drawn in the same cartoon family as The Vic 361 (ink outlines, sticker colors, Fredoka lettering), with this town's own palette and motifs. Every file in `public/` overrides Victoria's copy in `docs/` through `townAssetPath()` and the static overlay.

## Concept

Mt. McLoughlin (a snow-capped cone) over fir-green foothills and a teal river, with a pear-gold sun. The skyline puts the mountain behind the right side of downtown: a tall historic tower, an arched-window bank, awninged storefronts and pear trees. The Rogue River runs teal along the bottom. Out of town: vineyard rows with plum grapes on one side and a pear orchard on the other, with firs throughout. No flames, smoke or Table Rock.

Header wordmark (two-tone, for `siteNameHtml` in town.json): `The Rogue <span>541</span>`. The span is the tilted badge, filled with the `highlight` color.

## Files

| File | Size | Used by |
|---|---|---|
| `public/logo.svg` | 128 viewBox | share cards (`server/ogImage.js`, embedded as a data URI); text is converted to paths, so it needs no fonts |
| `public/logo.png` | 96x96 | header logo, light theme (shown at 48 to 54px, clipped round) |
| `public/logo-dark.png` | 96x96 | header logo, dark theme (adds a paper-colored halo so the ink ring shows on a dark header) |
| `public/logo-512.png` | 512x512 | schema.org Organization `logo` (`server/seo.js`) |
| `public/favicon.svg` | 64 viewBox | `<link rel=icon>` (simplified mark) |
| `public/favicon-32.png` | 32x32 | PNG favicon fallback |
| `public/favicon.ico` | 16, 32, 48 | `/favicon.ico` requests |
| `public/apple-touch-icon.png` | 180x180 | iOS home screen (opaque, paper background) |
| `public/og-image.png` | 1200x630 | site-wide og:image / twitter:image |
| `public/skyline.svg` | viewBox -800 0 2800 260 | hero art and footer (day); the town sits in x 0 to 1200, with countryside on either side |
| `public/skyline-night.svg` | same | hero art and footer (dark theme) |
| `public/email/skyline.png` | 1200x260 | newsletter header (`server/newsletter.js`) |

Not overridden, because they are shared and generic: `icons.svg` and the `email/*.png` category icons (food, music and the rest), plus `sample-logo.svg`. Victoria's `outdoors` icon is a cactus, which reads as Texan; a town could add its own `email/outdoors.png` (48x48) and a matching symbol later if that matters.

## Notes

- Lettering in every SVG (the sign and tank lettering in the skylines) is outlined to paths from `server/fonts/Fredoka-Bold.ttf`, so it renders the same in an `<img>`, in resvg share cards and in email, with no font loading.
- The PNGs were rasterized from the SVGs with Playwright (Chromium), and the `.ico` was built from the 16, 32 and 48px renders.
